  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a college student currently focused on learning about front-end development. <br>
    So far, I know HTML and CSS. I'm currently focused on bettering my skills with CSS, but I will soon learn Javascript. <br>
    I know the fundemental concepts of programming, specifically OOP, and I coded previously with Java and Python. <br>
    Although I'm pretty lazy, I will persist and do my best!
  </p>
