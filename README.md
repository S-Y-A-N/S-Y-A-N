  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a college student currently focused on learning about front-end development. <br>
    So far, I know a decent amount of HTML and CSS, and I recently started learning JavaScript. <br>
    I know the fundemental concepts of programming, specifically OOP, and I coded some basic stuff with Java and Python in the past. <br>
    Although I'm pretty lazy, I will persist and do my best!
